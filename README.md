# 👋 Welcome to MindHarbourAI

**MindHarbourAI** – *AI that understands CAD, so engineers can focus on design, not mistakes.*

We are building the **next-generation AI platform for engineering drawings and 3D CAD intelligence**. Our system can automatically detect errors, validate GD&T and dimensions, and provide actionable recommendations directly on your CAD drawings.
